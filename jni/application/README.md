## How to make a map

1) Place number of floors of map on first line
2) Place height of map on second line
3) Place width of map on third line
4) Start making your map! Below are the symbols for each game object:
  '.' => "Ground" 
  'b' => "Boulder" 
  'u' => "Ladder_Up" 
  'd' => "Ladder_Down" 
  'h' => "Hole" 
  'w' => "Water" 
  't' => "Tree"
  'f' => "Fire" 
  'i' => "Ice" 
  'A' => "Axe" 
  'D' => "Dumbbell"
  'B' => "Bucket"
  's' => "Starting position" (only one of these)
  'e' => "Exit" (at least one of these)
 'E' => "Place exit under a boulder"
 'a' => "Place axe under a boulder"
 'm' => "Place bucket under a boulder"
